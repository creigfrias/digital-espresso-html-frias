In my own static site, I used the flow Home > Menu > About > Branches for the website pages to guide users through a logical customer journey. The index/home page introduces the brand, the menu shows the products, the about page shares more information about the cafe, and the branches page provides location for those who are ready to visit the physical stores. I constructed all of the pages were connected through a consistent navigation menu for easy browsing. For the images, I set them in separate folders assigned per page and labeled the files using the first letter of the corresponding page followed by a number and name to keep them organized and easy to find.
